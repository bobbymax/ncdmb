**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**

---

## 📦 **WHAT WAS BUILT**

## 🎯 **THE PROBLEM WE SOLVED**

### **Before (Payment-Based Execution)**

```
❌ ProcessCard triggered on Payment approval
❌ All ProcessCards execute at same point
❌ No workflow stage awareness
❌ Can't control execution per stage
❌ Early stages forced to execute everything
```

### **After (Stage-Aware Execution)**

```
✅ ProcessCard attached to ProgressTracker stages
✅ Each stage has its own ProcessCard
✅ Executes as document advances through workflow
✅ Full control over when/where execution happens
✅ Early stages can validate, middle stages transact, final stages settle
```

---

## 📊 **THE 6 NEW PROPERTIES**

### **1. `min_stage_order` (number)**

```typescript
min_stage_order: 3;

// Don't execute this ProcessCard before stage 3
// Use case: Only generate transactions after initial approvals
```

### **2. `max_stage_order` (number)**

```typescript
max_stage_order: 5;

// Don't execute this ProcessCard after stage 5
// Use case: Early-stage validation only
```

### **3. `execute_at_stages` (number[])**

```typescript
execute_at_stages: [2, 4, 6];

// Only execute at these specific stage orders
// Use case: Execute at approval stages only
// Empty array = execute at all stages
```

### **4. `execute_at_final_stage_only` (boolean)**

```typescript
execute_at_final_stage_only: true;

// Only execute at the last workflow stage
// Use case: Final settlement and reconciliation
```

### **5. `requires_custom_inputs` (boolean)**

```typescript
requires_custom_inputs: true;

// Wait for user to provide custom inputs before executing
// Use case: Need approval amount or custom notes
```

### **6. `custom_input_fields` (string[])**

```typescript
custom_input_fields: ["approval_amount", "custom_note"];

// Required field names to check in payment.process_metadata
// Use case: Validate user provided specific data
```

## 🎛️ **CONFIGURATION EXAMPLES**

### **Example 1: Data Validation (Early Stage Only)**

```typescript
ProcessCard: "Data Validator"
Attached to: ProgressTracker #1 (Order=1)

Rules: {
  min_stage_order: 1,
  max_stage_order: 1,  // Only execute at stage 1
  generate_transactions: false,
  post_to_journal: false,
  auto_settle_fund: false,
  // Just validate, don't do anything else
}

Result:
  → Stage 1: ✅ Validates payment data
  → Stage 2: ⏭️  Skipped (max_stage_order=1)
  → Stage 3: ⏭️  Skipped
  → Stage 4: ⏭️  Skipped
```

### **Example 2: Transaction Generator (Specific Stages)**

```typescript
ProcessCard: "Transaction Generator"
Attached to: ProgressTracker #2 (Order=2)

Rules: {
  execute_at_stages: [2, 4],  // Only at stages 2 and 4
  generate_transactions: true,
  create_contra_entries: true,
  post_to_journal: false,  // Don't post yet
  auto_settle_fund: false,  // Don't settle yet
}

Result:
  → Stage 1: ⏭️  Skipped (not in execute_at_stages)
  → Stage 2: ✅ Generates transactions
  → Stage 3: ⏭️  Skipped
  → Stage 4: ✅ Generates transactions (if needed)
```

### **Example 3: Final Settlement (Last Stage Only)**

```typescript
ProcessCard: "Final Settler"
Attached to: ProgressTracker #4 (Order=4)

Rules: {
  execute_at_final_stage_only: true,  // Only at final stage
  min_stage_order: 4,
  generate_transactions: false,  // Already generated earlier
  post_to_journal: true,
  auto_settle_fund: true,
  update_trial_balance: true,
  require_reconciliation: true,
}

Result:
  → Stage 1: ⏭️  Skipped
  → Stage 2: ⏭️  Skipped
  → Stage 3: ⏭️  Skipped
  → Stage 4: ✅ Posts to ledger
              ✅ Settles fund
              ✅ Updates trial balance
              ✅ Schedules reconciliation
```

### **Example 4: Custom Input Required**

```typescript
ProcessCard: "Approval Processor"
Attached to: ProgressTracker #3 (Order=3)

Rules: {
  min_stage_order: 3,
  requires_custom_inputs: true,
  custom_input_fields: ["approval_amount", "approver_note"],
  generate_transactions: true,
  post_to_journal: true,
}

User Flow:
  1. Document reaches stage 3
  2. ProcessCard checks for custom inputs
  3. Finds approval_amount missing → ⏸️  WAITS
  4. User provides:
     - approval_amount: 50000
     - approver_note: "Approved by finance committee"
  5. User clicks "Execute ProcessCard" OR next stage advancement
  6. ProcessCard checks again → ✅ All inputs present
  7. Executes accounting cycle
```

## 🔍 **MONITORING & DEBUGGING**

### **Check Stage Execution History**

```sql
-- See which stages executed ProcessCards
SELECT
  p.id,
  p.code,
  p.process_metadata->>'$.last_stage_execution.stage_order' as last_stage,
  p.process_metadata->>'$.last_stage_execution.stage_name' as stage_name,
  p.process_metadata->>'$.last_stage_execution.executed_at' as executed_at
FROM payments p
WHERE p.process_metadata IS NOT NULL;

-- See complete execution history
SELECT
  p.id,
  JSON_EXTRACT(p.process_metadata, '$.execution_history') as history
FROM payments p
WHERE p.process_metadata IS NOT NULL;
```

### **Check Which Stage a Document is At**

```sql
-- Current stage of document
SELECT
  d.id,
  d.ref,
  d.progress_tracker_id,
  pt.order as current_stage_order,
  ws.name as current_stage_name,
  pt.process_card_id,
  pc.name as process_card_name
FROM documents d
JOIN progress_trackers pt ON d.progress_tracker_id = pt.id
JOIN workflow_stages ws ON pt.workflow_stage_id = ws.id
LEFT JOIN process_cards pc ON pt.process_card_id = pc.id
WHERE d.documentable_type = 'App\\Models\\Payment';
```

### **Check ProcessCard Configuration per Stage**

```sql
-- All ProcessCards attached to ProgressTrackers
SELECT
  pt.id as tracker_id,
  pt.order as stage_order,
  ws.name as stage_name,
  pc.id as process_card_id,
  pc.name as process_card_name,
  pc.rules->>'$.min_stage_order' as min_order,
  pc.rules->>'$.max_stage_order' as max_order,
  pc.rules->>'$.execute_at_stages' as specific_stages,
  pc.rules->>'$.execute_at_final_stage_only' as final_only
FROM progress_trackers pt
JOIN workflow_stages ws ON pt.workflow_stage_id = ws.id
LEFT JOIN process_cards pc ON pt.process_card_id = pc.id
ORDER BY pt.workflow_id, pt.order;
```

### **View Logs**

```bash
# Stage advancement logs
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep "Document advanced to new stage"

# ProcessCard execution logs
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep "ProcessCard executed on stage advancement"

# Stage execution skipped logs
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep "ProcessCard should not execute at this stage"
```

## ✅ **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

After deployment:

-   [ ] Run migrations (no new migrations needed!)
-   [ ] Clear cache: `php artisan config:clear && php artisan cache:clear`
-   [ ] Create test ProcessCards with stage rules
-   [ ] Attach ProcessCards to ProgressTrackers
-   [ ] Create test payment document
-   [ ] Advance document through stages
-   [ ] Verify ProcessCard executes at correct stages
-   [ ] Verify ProcessCard skips at incorrect stages
-   [ ] Check payment.process_metadata for stage context
-   [ ] Test custom input requirements
-   [ ] Test execute_at_final_stage_only
-   [ ] Review logs for stage advancement

---

## 🎯 **BENEFITS**

### **1. Fine-Grained Control**

```
✅ Control WHEN ProcessCard executes
✅ Control WHERE in workflow it executes
✅ Control WHAT actions happen at each stage
```

### **2. Workflow Integration**

```
✅ Respects existing ProgressTracker workflow
✅ Executes as documents naturally progress
✅ No manual ProcessCard triggering needed
```

### **3. Flexibility**

```
✅ Early stages: Validation only
✅ Middle stages: Transaction generation
✅ Late stages: Posting and settlement
✅ Final stage: Reconciliation
```

### **4. Safety**

```
✅ Can't settle before approval
✅ Can't post without transactions
✅ Can't reconcile before settlement
✅ Custom inputs ensure human oversight
```

### **5. Auditability**

```
✅ Complete stage execution history
✅ Know which stage did what
✅ Timestamp every stage execution
✅ Track custom inputs provided
```

## 📝 **QUICK REFERENCE**

### **Property Quick Guide**

```typescript
min_stage_order: 3; // Don't run before stage 3
max_stage_order: 5; // Don't run after stage 5
execute_at_stages: [2, 4]; // Only run at stages 2 and 4
execute_at_final_stage_only; // Only run at last stage
requires_custom_inputs; // Wait for user inputs
custom_input_fields; // Required field names
```

### **Common Patterns**

```typescript
// Pattern 1: Validation only (early stage)
{ min_stage_order: 1, max_stage_order: 1 }

// Pattern 2: Specific stages
{ execute_at_stages: [2, 4, 6] }

// Pattern 3: Final stage only
{ execute_at_final_stage_only: true, min_stage_order: 5 }

// Pattern 4: After certain stage
{ min_stage_order: 3 }

// Pattern 5: Custom inputs required
{ requires_custom_inputs: true, custom_input_fields: ["amount"] }
```
